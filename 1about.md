For my Bachelor's I studied Chemical Engineering. Unfortunately, I couldn't motivate myself further to stick to it. I changed my stream to Nuclear Engineering for my Master's. That decision was life changing. The knowledge of chemical engineering with my zeal to understand physics motivated me to pursue research. I joined Institute for Plasma Research (IPR) as a Research Scholar to pursue PhD. IPR is an institute of Dept. of Atomic Energy, India working primarily on fundamental plasma physics and nuclear fusion engineering.

I was born on a winter morning at Guwahati, Assam in North-Eastern India and brought up there by my parents. After schooling, I moved down south, Chennai for Bachelors and then north, Dehradun for Masters. As of I now I am based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat  (western India)  for my doctoral studies. Poster boy of National Integration, maybe.  I like to engage in conversations related to science, philosophy and psychology. I travel quite often. I like to hike and explore the villages of India and write about my travels and post photo stories in my [personal blog](https://www.arnabdeka.in "Empty Spaces"). <https://www.arnabdeka.in>.
