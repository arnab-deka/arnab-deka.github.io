#### PhD student at Institute for Plasma Research, Dept. of Atomic Energy, India.   


I am a Nuclear Engineer working on an experimental project for future fusion reactors. Currently I am pursuing PhD at IPR, India under the supervision of Dr. Mainak Bandyopadhyay and collaborating with Ms. Bharathi P. The project involves design and development of a Doppler Shift spectroscopy system  for characterization of hydrogen beam to estimate the beam divergence and the inhomogeneity for *International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)*  Diagnostic Neutral Beam. The experimental activities for are being conducted on the RF Operated Negative Ion Source (ROBIN) and modelling and simulation studies are in progress for the ITER-Diagnostic Neutral Beam.
